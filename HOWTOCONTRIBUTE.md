# Here are the steps to make changes to the project

## 1. Fork this repository
  A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## 2. Cloning(downloading) your forked version of the project to your computer
  Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.
  -You will need git installed on your computer(mac and linux already have it).
    Windows install -> https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git
