# Here are the steps to make changes to our project


## 1. Fork this repository
  A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
  
  
## 2. Cloning(downloading) your forked version of the project to your computer
  Right now, you have a fork of the project repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.
    You will need git installed on your computer (mac and linux already have it).
      Windows install -> https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git
    Now open up a terminal or a command line and follow the instructions bellow:
      https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
  
  
## 3. Make your changes
  This could include:
    Adding files
    Modyfing files
    Adding documentation/designs/plans etc


## 4. Test your changes
  In order to ensure your changes dont break the main codebase, try testing with a bunch of different input before you submit it.
 
 
## 5. Submit a pull-request
  A pull/merge request means you made some changes, and are asking for your code to be reviewed and eventually pulled to the project repository
  
  Heres how to perform one:
